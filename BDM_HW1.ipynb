    "This homework is for practicing Python’s *generators* and the design of *streaming* algorithms in general. We’re going to use the **citibike.csv** data set that we had played around with in the labs, and another Citibike's data set called **citibike_docking_events.csv**. Both of them are available CUNY Blackboard under *Data Sets* section. You are required to turn in this notebook with all the parts filled in place of <###>. Your notebook must be named BDM\\_HW1.ipynb."

    "Your task is to write a generator to extract the first ride of the day from a Citibike data stream. The data stream is sorted based on starting times. The first ride of the day is interpreted as the ride with the earliest starting time of a day. For the sample data, which is a week worth of citibike records, your generator should only generate 7 items (one for each day).\n",

    "You are given a template with the sample generator **firstRide**. The generator currently takes in **csv.DictReader** generator and output its first element. Please adjust this generator to output the first ride of the day for the entire stream as specified above. The output of the generator must be in the same format as csv.DictReader. You can think of this generator as a filter only passing certain records out."
